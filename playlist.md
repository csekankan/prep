# LeetCode Interview Pick List — ROI Order

> **285 problems** · ordered by interview ROI (frequency × pattern value)
> Pick from top, solve downward. Each row tells you **why**, **topic**, and your **status**.
>
> Regenerate with updated submissions: `python3 generate_topic_pick_list.py`

---

## How to Use

1. Solve Tier 1 first — these alone make you interview-ready
2. Move to Tier 2 for strong coverage at top companies
3. Tier 3 & 4 for thorough prep if you have time
4. Within each tier: problems you haven't seen (🆕/⚠️) come before ones you've solved

## Status Legend

| Flag | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| 🆕 NEW | Never attempted — blind spot |
| ⚠️ HEAVY | 10+ attempts — fundamental gap |
| 🔁 RETRY | 6–9 attempts — almost mastered |
| ✅ OK | 3–5 attempts — timed redo |
| 💤 SOLID | 1–2 attempts — you know this |
